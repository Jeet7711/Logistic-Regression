# Logistic-Regression
Logistic regression is particularly useful for classification tasks, where the goal is to assign observations to one of the two categories based on a set of predictor variables.
Logistic regression is a popular statistical modeling technique used to predict the probability of a binary outcome. It is commonly employed when the dependent variable, also known as the response variable, is categorical and can take one of two possible values (e.g., "yes" or "no," "success" or "failure," "0" or "1").
The logistic regression model is based on the logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function), which maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1. The logistic function is defined as follows:

p = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))

In this equation, p represents the probability of the outcome being in the positive category, e is the base of the natural logarithm, and z is a linear combination of the predictor variables.
The general form of the logistic regression equation with multiple predictor variables is:

logit(p) = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₚXₚ   Here, logit(p) represents the log-odds of the outcome being in the positive category, X₁, X₂, ..., Xₚ are the predictor variables, β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., βₚ are the coefficients associated with each predictor variable, and ⁿ represents the number of predictor variables.
Logistic regression has applications in various fields, including medicine, social sciences, finance, marketing, and machine learning. It is widely used for tasks such as disease diagnosis, customer churn prediction, credit risk assessment, and sentiment analysis.
